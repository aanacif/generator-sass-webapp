# Gulp Sass Front-end boilerplate

## Installation instructions

In order to have this workflow running you need to have [Yeoman generator](https://yeoman.io/) ecosystem globally installed:

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

As well as the gulp-cli:

```bash
npm install -g gulp-cli
```

And finally the sass-webapp generator itself:

```bash
npm install -g generator-sass-webapp
```

## Usage

When/if you already have those installed, create a new project folder and while inside it type:

```bash
yo sass-webapp
```

That's it! To have Gulp running head to the project folder command line and type: `gulp`

### Notes

Images that you place on the app/images folder will be automatically converted to .webp format under the dist/images folder, so you might want to refer to those in your code.
