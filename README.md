# Gulp Sass Front-end boilerplate

## Installation instructions

In order to use this workflow you need to have [Yeoman generator](https://yeoman.io/) npm package globally installed:  
`npm install -g yo`

As well as the gulp-cli:  
`npm install -g gulp-cli`

And then the sass-webapp generator itself:  
`npm install -g generator-sass-webapp`

When/if you already have those installed, create a new project folder and type:  
`yo sass-webapp`

That's it, now in order to have Gulp running, head to the project folder command line and type: `gulp`
